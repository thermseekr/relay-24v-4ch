# Relay-24V-4ch

Relay board with 4x 24 VDC 10A relays. This board is designed to be used togheter with [ESP-24V-16CH](https://github.com/thermseekr/ESP-24v-16ch) and [ESP-24V-32CH](https://github.com/thermseekr/ESP-24v-32ch), but can be driven by any 24V control circuit compatible with NPN inputs.

The dimensions are such that the boards can be mounted on a PCB DIN rail holder from the Brazilian manufacturer Metaltex, check [here](https://www.metaltex.com.br/produtos/componentes/suportes/sp7-suporte-para-montagem-de-placa-de-circuito-impresso-em-trilho-din) for details.

Board V1 uses Omron 16A relays, board V2 uses Songle 10A relays. Both boards are limited do 10A due tue PCB trace capacity, but Omron relays are expecter to last longer when driving heavy loads.
